# 🎭 StageLink User Experience (UX) Verification Report

**Date:** January 29, 2026
**Tester:** Jules (AI Agent)

## 📝 Executive Summary
A comprehensive UX verification was performed, focusing on the User Signup Journey and the Producer Onboarding experience. The testing involved both automated interaction scripts and code analysis.

## ✅ Verified Features (Working Well)
*   **Signup Flow Navigation:** The transition from Login to Signup and the selection between "Audience" and "Theater Group" roles is clear and responsive.
*   **Form Validation:**
    *   Password strength requirements are enforced correctly.
    *   Password confirmation matching works.
    *   **Consent Mandatory:** The "Terms of Service" and "Privacy Policy" checkbox is strictly enforced; the "Create Account" button is correctly disabled until consent is given.
*   **Visual Feedback:** The application provides clear visual feedback (shake animations, toast notifications) for errors.

## ⚠️ UX Issues & Bugs Found

### 1. Accessibility: Floating Input Labels
*   **Severity:** Medium (Accessibility)
*   **Observation:** The `FloatingInput` component used in the Login/Signup forms uses a visually positioned `motion.label` but does not programmatically associate it with the `<input>` field using the `htmlFor` attribute.
*   **Impact:** Screen readers and automation tools (like Playwright's `get_by_label`) cannot find the input fields by their visible name. This degrades the experience for visually impaired users.
*   **Recommendation:** Update `FloatingInput` to pass the `id` to the label's `htmlFor` attribute.

### 2. Producer Onboarding Tour Fragility
*   **Severity:** Low (Edge Case)
*   **Observation:** The `TourGuide` component targets specific DOM IDs:
    *   `#dashboard-stats`
    *   `#add-show-button`
    *   `#profile-tab`
*   **Risk:** In `Dashboard.tsx`, if the user's trial is expired, the `#add-show-button` is replaced by a "Trial Expired" alert. If a user somehow enters this state during onboarding, the tour step targeting the button will fail or hang.
*   **Recommendation:** Ensure the tour step has a fallback or conditional check for the trial state, or ensure new users always have a valid trial (which seems to be the case currently).

### 3. Infinite Loading State (Test Environment)
*   **Severity:** N/A (Test specific, but worth noting)
*   **Observation:** The Dashboard failed to load in the simulated test environment due to strict dependency on Supabase Auth initialization. The application shows a "Loading dashboard..." spinner indefinitely if the auth session checks hang.
*   **UX Implication:** In poor network conditions, a real user might see this infinite spinner without a timeout or error message.
*   **Recommendation:** Implement a timeout for the initial data fetch/auth check to show a "Failed to load" retry button instead of spinning forever.

## 📸 Artifacts
