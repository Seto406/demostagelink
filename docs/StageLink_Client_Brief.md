# 🎭 StageLink: Project Overview & Client Brief

**Date:** February 11, 2026

## 1. Executive Summary

**StageLink** is a digital platform connecting audiences with local and university theater productions in Metro Manila. It serves as a unified discovery layer, bridging the gap between theater groups (producers) and theater enthusiasts (audience).

Unlike traditional ticketing platforms that focus solely on transactions, StageLink emphasizes **community, discovery, and engagement**. It aims to be the "MyAnimeList for Theater," where users not only buy tickets but also build a reputation, share reviews, and connect with other fans.

## 2. The Vision: "MyAnimeList for Theater"

The core vision is to transform the theater-going experience from a solitary transaction into a social, gamified journey.

### Key Pillars:
*   **The Social Portal:** A "Lobby" experience that welcomes users into a community. Dark mode, elegant design, and live activity feeds create a buzzing atmosphere.
*   **Gamification ("The Prestige Path"):** Users earn XP and level up from "Newcomer" to "Patron of the Arts" by engaging with the platform (buying tickets, writing reviews, commenting).
*   **Unified Discovery:** A single destination to find shows across Metro Manila, regardless of the production scale (professional or university).

## 3. The Manila Context & Competition

**Market:** Metro Manila (e.g., Makati, Quezon City, Manila).
**Competition:** TicketWorld, TicketNet.

### Competitive Advantage:
While TicketWorld and TicketNet are purely transactional platforms for purchasing tickets, **StageLink** differentiates itself by:
*   **Community First:** Focusing on the *social* aspect of theater—reviews, ratings, and user profiles.
*   **Discovery Layer:** Aggregating shows from smaller, independent, and university groups that may not be listed on major ticketing sites.
*   **Producer Empowerment:** Providing tools for theater groups to manage their brand, cast lists, and audience engagement directly.

StageLink acts as a **marketing and community engine** that can link out to official ticketing pages (including TicketWorld/TicketNet) or facilitate direct sales for smaller productions.

## 4. Project Status: Phase 1 Foundation (Complete ✅)

The platform is currently live with a robust foundation.

### For Audiences:
*   **Directory:** Browse shows by location (City-Based Search).
*   **Personalization:** Favorites and Watchlist features.
*   **Show Details:** Comprehensive info including cast, crew, and ticket links.

### For Producers:
*   **Dashboard:** Manage show listings and profile details.
*   **Cast & Crew:** Showcase team members with roles and photos.
*   **Analytics:** Basic insights into show performance.

### For Admins:
*   **Approval Workflow:** Quality control for all listings.
*   **Broadcast System:** Email notifications to the audience base.

## 5. Roadmap

*   **Phase 2: Growth (Q1 2026)** - Real-time analytics, enhanced profiles, and social login.
*   **Phase 3: Scale (Q2 2026)** - Mobile apps (iOS/Android), Pro subscriptions, and expansion beyond Metro Manila.
