# Producer Moderation Guide

As a **Producer** on StageLink, you have the ability to moderate comments on your own **Shows** and **Feed Posts**. This ensures your community remains respectful and safe.

## Moderating Show Comments

When users comment on one of your productions:

1.  **Navigate to the Show Page**: Go to the details page of your show.
2.  **Locate the Comment**: Scroll down to the "Audience Reviews" or "Comments" section.
3.  **Hover Over the Comment**: Move your mouse cursor over the comment you wish to remove.
4.  **Click the Trash Icon**: A trash can icon <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-trash-2"><path d="M3 6h18"/><path d="M19 6v14c0 1-1 2-2 2H7c-1 0-2-1-2-2V6"/><path d="M8 6V4c0-1 1-2 2-2h4c1 0 2 1 2 2v2"/><line x1="10" x2="10" y1="11" y2="17"/><line x1="14" x2="14" y1="11" y2="17"/></svg> will appear next to the comment timestamp. Click it.
5.  **Confirm**: The comment will be immediately removed from public view.

## Moderating Feed Post Comments

When you post an update on the feed:

1.  **View Comments**: Click the "Comment" button on your post to expand the comment section.
2.  **Find the Comment**: Locate the inappropriate or hateful comment.
3.  **Hover and Delete**: Hover over the comment to reveal the delete button (trash icon) and click it.

## Important Notes

*   **Soft Deletion**: Comments are "soft deleted," meaning they are hidden from the application but retained in the database for audit purposes if needed.
*   **Permissions**: You can only delete comments on **your own shows** and **your own posts**. You cannot delete comments on other producers' content unless you are an Admin.
*   **Admins**: Site administrators also have the ability to remove any comment across the platform.
