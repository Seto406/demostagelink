## 🛠️ Tech Stack

| Category | Technology |
|----------|------------|
| Frontend | React 18, TypeScript, Vite |
| Styling | Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui |
| Backend | Supabase (PostgreSQL, Auth, Storage, Edge Functions) |
| Animations | Framer Motion |
| Email | Resend |
| Hosting | Lovable Cloud |

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 20 and pnpm
- Supabase project

### Local Development

```sh
# Clone the repository
git clone <YOUR_GIT_URL>
cd demostagelink

# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Start development server
pnpm dev
```

### Environment Variables (Vercel)
Set these in your Vercel project settings (do not commit `.env` files):

**Client (safe to expose via Vite):**
- `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`
- `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
- `VITE_SUPABASE_PROJECT_ID` (optional)

**Server-only (must never be `VITE_*`):**
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`
- `ADMIN_ACTION_KEY`

Use `.env.example` as the template for local values.

### Admin Actions Flow
- The frontend calls Vercel API routes under `/api/admin/*`.
- The API route verifies the caller is an admin and checks `ADMIN_ACTION_KEY`.
- Privileged actions (like deleting users) run server-side with `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`.

---

## 🔒 Security Notes
- Secrets were previously committed in this repository. Rotate any exposed keys immediately, especially `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` and any admin keys.
- If this repository was public, scrub git history to permanently remove leaked secrets.
- Never store privileged secrets in `VITE_*` variables because Vite bundles them into client code.

## 🚀 Deployment Notes

- Apply the latest SQL migration in Supabase (SQL Editor or Supabase CLI), including theater group RLS policy updates before deploying.
- `send-collab-proposal` uses in-function auth validation (`auth.getUser()` with `Authorization: Bearer <access_token>`); `verify_jwt` is disabled for this function in `supabase/config.toml`.
- Edge Function env vars required: `SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`, and `RESEND_API_KEY` (for email delivery).
- Producer theater-group saves rely on `profiles.id` ownership for `theater_groups.owner_id`; ensure producer profiles exist before saving.
- Producer edit modals now save unsaved drafts to `sessionStorage` per route + modal + user key, so transient refreshes won't drop in-progress form data.
